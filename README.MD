### Additional installations
To use the prepared scenes/adventure made by [Paizo](https://paizo.com/) you need to place the content of the art assets into the following folder `<FoundryDataFolder>/proprietary-assets/<ProductId-ProductName>/`. The `ProductId` is the offical store id found on the store page. The `ProductName` is the title of the book/pdf excluding Pathfinder. For the one-shot Sundered Waves it would be `<FoundryDataFolder>/proprietary-assets/PZO1001E-Sundered-Waves/`
